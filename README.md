## General info
This web app deploy a machine learning app that can provide prediction whether the worker will **LEFT** or **STAY** based on several parameter.
The machine learning model is built from a public dataset acqquired in Kaggle (link) and parameter is selected by using a correlation matrix.

The project is actually a spin off to my assignment during AirAsia Reskill programm which is to deploy a web app with machine learning model that can predict target by certain features.
	
## Technologies
Project is created using Python 3.9 with following packages:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Sklearn
* streamlit.io

## Next improvement
There is other step or features can be added to the web app to increase its functioanlity:
* Make a proper UI to ease the user in using the web app
* Increasing the accuracy of the model by selecting parameter and removing outliers.
